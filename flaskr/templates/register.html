      <h3>How we hope to help</h3>
	<p>Our goal today is to Save The World by connecting you and your loved ones around you. Here at STWISH,
	we allow a user to maintain a small, minimal-effort journal about their health, habits, and happiness.
	What really makes STWISH special is not only the ability of your approved loved ones to see your personal
	updates, but also to be notified when your journal entries imply a difficult time for you. They'll be there, ready to help you before you even have to ask.</p>
